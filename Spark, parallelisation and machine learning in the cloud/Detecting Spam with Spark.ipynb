    "# Coursework Part 1: Detecting Spam with Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the tasks for IN432 Big Data coursework 2020, part 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework is about classification of e-mail messages as spam or non-spam in Spark. We will go through the whole process from loading and preprocessing to training and testing classifiers in a distributed way in Spark. We wil use the techniques shown in the lextures and labs. A few additional elements will be introduced here, such as the Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) and some of the preprocessing and machine learning functions that come with Spark. You are not expected to need anything beyond the material handed out so far and in some cases the Spark documentation, which is linked from this document.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure is similar to the lab sheets. A code structure is provided with gaps that you are supposed to fill in. In addition you should run 2 small experiments and comment on the results. The lines where you are supposed to add code or take another action are marked with \">>>\" \n",
    "please leave the \">>>\" in the text, comment out that line, and write your own code in the next line using a copy of that line as a starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerous comments have been added in the text and code cells to guide you through the program. Please read them carefully and ask if anything is unclear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the tasks, don't delete the outputs, but download the notebook by clicking on *File* ➡︎ *Download .ipynb* (outputs will be included) and upload it into the coursework submission area on Moodle. This part counts for 50% of the total coursework."

    "Now we need to split the words, a process called *tokenization* by linguists, and remove punctuation. \n",

    "a) We will use the Python [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org) (*NLTK*) to do the tokenization (rather than splitting ourselves, as these specialist tools usually do that better than we can ourselves).

There is no specific function for this, so we use a regular expression (see here for info [https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#module-re)) in a list comprehension (here's a nice visual explanation: [http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/](http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/)). (5%)\n",
    "\n",
    "c) We use a new technique here: we separate keys and values of the RDD, using the RDD functions `keys()` and `values()`, each of which yield a new RDD. Then we process the values and *zip* them together with the keys again. See here for documentation: [http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.5/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.zip](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.5/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.RDD.zip).

    "- Experiment 1 shows that for a small value of n, the size of the hash words, the three models have a comparable performance. The models have a low variance as the training and testing accuracy are the same. Also, the small value of the accuracies (0.83) shows a high bias in the models. It might be due to overlapping in hashing words. \n",
    "- Increasing n improves the performance of the logistic regression significantly (from 0.83 for n=3 to 0.97 for n=30000 on the testing set) and reduces the bias of the model. An asymptote is reached from n=3000 with a testing score of 0.97 and a training score of 1. This model has a low variance and low bias.\n",
    "- The performance of Naive Bayes is improving from n =300 to n=3000. The model for n=3000 has a low variance and low bias. However, for n=30000, it seems that NB has more difficulties to predict the class correctly for large vectors. The 30000 features generated might not respect the normal distribution and/or independence assumptions for NB. \n",
    "- SVM with SGD has the same performance whatever the size of the vector is. It has high bias and low variance. It could be explained by the low computational efficiency of SVMs for a dataset with a large number of rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Experiment 2**\n",
    "- The same observation as for experiment 1 is made for SVM with SGD. The accuracies stay at 0.83.\n",
    "- NB has better testing and training accuracies for \"bare\" data (0.7 for train and 0.96 for test). \"lemm\" data increases the variance of the model as the testing accuracy is 0.95 and the training accuracy is 0.97. \"stop\" data increases the bias of the model and \"lemm_stop\" data increases the variance and the bias.\n",
    "- LR performs better on \"stop\" and \"lemm\" data (1 for training, 0.98 for testing). The variance is smaller than on \"bare\" and \"lemm_stop\" data.\n",
    "- The smaller performance on \"lemm_stop\" data than on the other datasets could be explained by the fact that raw words or stop words help to identify spams. Indeed, some characters as \"!\" are widely used in spams.\n"
